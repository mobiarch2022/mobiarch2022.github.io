\section*{Preface}
This volume contains the papers presented at MobiArch 2022: Workshop on Mobility in the Evolving Internet Architecture 2022 held on October 21, 2022 in Sydney.



There were 14 submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least 3, and on the average 4.8, program committee members. The committee decided to accept 10 papers. The program also includes 3 invited talks.



\textbf{Abstract}



According to Cisco Annual Internet Report, over 70 percent of the global population will have mobile connectivity by 2023, while machine-to-machine (M2M) communications will account for half of the global connections. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak accelerated the need for reliable broadband Internet and mobility support at scale.Accordingly, the last two decades have witnessed the continuous evolution of mobile network architectures to support the unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic and quality of service demands. Higher-throughput and lower-latency 5G networks, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, Mobile Edge Computing, Open RAN, and RAN disaggregation are only a few of the research trends that promise to deliver a more reliable, faster, and secure mobile Internet experience.ACM MobiArch 2022 will continue to serve as a forum for discussing recent research trends and future directions gathered around all aspects of mobile communication technologies and mobile Internet architectures, such as system and radio access challenges that have to be faced to implement reliable, optimized, and scalable mobile networked systems.



\textbf{Introduction}



ACM MobiArch has advanced to its 17th anniversary as one consolidated tradition for bringing together an important number of researchers and industry players working in different aspects of mobile communication technologies and mobile network architectures. The workshop will continue to serve as a forum for discussing recent research trends and future directions gathered around all aspects of mobile communication technologies and mobile Internet architectures, such as system and radio access challenges that have to be faced to implement reliable, optimized, and scalable mobile networked systems.
